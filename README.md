# iOS-Kodi-Remote
This project aims to develop an application like Kore for the iOS platform.

It's my first project in Swift, so please be indulgent. 

Every tricks in good to take ;)
If you think that filenames should be renamed to be more Swift-compliant, please tell me.

Phase 1: find & connect to a Kodi server with zeroConf
Phase 2: create a simple remote (up, down, left, right, ok)
Phase 3: a little bit of UI (based on Android UI)
Phase 3.1: maybe a first release on the AppStore
Phase 4: fetch all movies, tv shows & music
